#Funiculus (WIP)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sergigp/funiculus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sergigp/funiculus)

Funiculus is a port of some Clojure functions and ideas to PHP. It works with PHP iterables (arrays, objects that implements Iterator interface, and generators)
 
This project is strongly inspired by [pablodip/felpado](https://github.com/pablodip/felpado) and [nikic/iter](https://github.com/nikic/iter]).
