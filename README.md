#Funiculus (WIP)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sergigp/funiculus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sergigp/funiculus)

Funiculus is a toy project to help me understand some Clojure concepts and how PHP can (or cannot) work with it. This project is strongly inspired by [pablodip/felpado](https://github.com/pablodip/felpado) and [nikic/iter](https://github.com/nikic/iter]).

##Use

Install through composer:

```
composer require sergigp/funiculus:dev-master
```

Add the namespace

```
use Sergigp\Funiculus as f;
```

Enjoy!
